            In this study, we conduct research on how people negotiate and form coalitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            TYou are one of three people negotiating how to allocate a sum ofÂ 
            <span class="text-info">{{params.total_sum_of_outcomes}} points</span>,
            an outcome that is equally important to all of you. It is important to realize
            that you are not able to obtain the outcome by yourself and consequently you need to
            join forces with another individual. This means that you need to form a coalition in which
            you need to reach an agreement about the allocation of the outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the following page we will explain more about the bargaining position of each person and the possible coalitions.
